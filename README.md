# asmehack
This is the repo for the ASME Hackathon.


Where we:


• Integrated multi-modality features into one model, including building command, camera images, and manufacturing locations; designed a feature set by converting manufacture parameters into images using physical principles.


• Using CNN to predict the melting pool parameters as result of additive manufacturing, compared performance of prevalent CNN architectures. Implemented Conditional-GAN for predicting the melting pool images during melting pool formation.
